TODOs for this plugin
=====================

Brefore reporting a new Issue please read this document, if your problem/idea is in this list its resolution/implemetation it's already planned.

- [*] Change the implementation to `jQuery(wrapperSelector)`, instead of using
    the option `wrapperID : wrapperSelector,`
- [*] Make it compatible with jQuery method chaining system
    ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining#jQuery )
- [ ] Improve support to the ``$.each()`` implementation. for now only works
    without problems only on one element.
- [ ] Add some callbacks: ``onBuild``, ``onGalleryLoaded``,
    ``onSlideshowBuild``, ``onSlideshowStart``, ``onSlideshowStop``,
    ``onSlideshowStop``, ``onSlideshowDestroy``, ``onGalleryDestroy``
